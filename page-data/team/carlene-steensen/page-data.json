Since the time she worked in a salon when she was in high school she knew the beauty industry was where she was meant to be. After high school, she attended Great Basin College but quickly realized that doing hair was her passion. Since attending and finishing Oliver Finley Academy in Boise she knows she’s right where she’s meant to be. Carlene is excited to be back in Elko to share her passion for the industry in the town she calls home. Carlene loves blonding, all things color, styling, and is excited to further her education in the beauty industry. She loves meeting and interacting with new people and takes pride in her ability to care for her guests. Carlene lives by the quote “In the end, we only regret the chances we didn’t take”. She can’t wait to have you in her chair!</p>"}},"pageContext":{"id":"37b3b73b-80fc-5f95-9dd0-f427f6d05459"}},
